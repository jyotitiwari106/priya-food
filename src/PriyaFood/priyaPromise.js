            Traditional food is timeless. It is not only deeply nourishing, it
            is a pleasure to savour, and share! Nothing beats the enticing aroma
            of a slowly simmering pot of sambar rice, the tempting look of the
            red hot mango pickle, or the soul-warming deliciousness of the tangy
            rasam. Truth be told, traditional recipes are no less than precious
            heirlooms passed down from generation to generation!

            Priya Foods has its roots in tradition. A tradition of good,
            wholesome food prepared with minimally processed ingredients in a
            manner as close as possible to how your great-grandmother would have
            made it for you. With love, with diligence, and with no room for the
            slightest compromise – be it in the goodness of the ingredients, in
            the method of preparation, or in the time taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Priya Foods brings to you and to your family…the
            <strong>Joy of Traditional Taste</strong> ! In particular, Telugu
            taste from the two states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Because
            we believe that the beauty of food nostalgia keeps hearts connected
            wherever we are. Our recipes, the spices and ingredients we pick,
            the methods we follow, even the implements we use, are the kind that
            would get the nod of approval from even the purists.
